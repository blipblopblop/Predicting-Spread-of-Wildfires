# Predicting-Spread-of-Wildfires
reate system to prevent forest fires, we need to understand the causes of forest fires. To do so, we will try to predict and explain the cause of forest fires. [1]  The important area of research this project will focus on is:       â€¢  Prediction of Spread of Wildfire (burned area in future) due to wind, rain, RF, and temperature respectivly
